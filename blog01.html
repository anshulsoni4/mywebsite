					<h2>Why You Should Code ?</h2>

						<p>A music producer or record producer is a recording project's creative and technical leader, commanding studio time and coaching There’s no denying that technology now dominates a huge amount of different industries. Being computer illiterate just won’t cut it any more in the world of work. And ‘learning to code’ seems to be the buzzword at the moment. And everyone from Bill Gates to Obama is encouraging young people to give it a go.Coding is the fundamental skill for jobs such as software development. There is currently a shortage of software developers worldwide, so learning to code can be an easy route into an open field of work. However, this isn’t the only way coding can open up job opportunities.For smaller start-ups, hiring someone solely to take care of coding and web design may not be the most economically viable choice. Having coding as a string to your bow can be key to finding jobs related to the field (like content creation, marketing, PR and more).Even if you’re applying for a position which has no direct relevancy to coding, it’s still well known as a useful skill. Thus, by having any knowledge of it, you’ll automatically give yourself a foot up on the competition. <br><br>
						On top of it being a generally worthwhile skill in most jobs, it also shows that you’re hardworking, dynamic, and a self-starter.If you’re wanting to go freelance, or have the ability to work while traveling, coding may be a great way to get into this. As coding is a highly valued skill at the moment, many companies are willing to outsource the work. This means skilled coders have the ability to create their own schedule (and charge a nice rate for it at the same time).
						Outside from the implications of coding which look good on a resume, coding actually does boost skills which are actually useful to most jobs. Problem solving and logic are the main two. Learning to code is like an exercise session for the “left” side of the brain. Coding for most big projects tends to be a collaborative effort. This means having to work as one cog as part of a greater team. Learning how to best interact with bosses and co-workers is an essential work skill, and it can often be developed through coding.

					<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
					<small>Posted on <time datetime="2021-07-05">July 05, 2021</time></small>
					</section>
					
					<section class="post-body">
						<p>Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.” Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors. <br><br>
						Machine language is a type of low-level programming language. It is also called as machine code or object code. Machine language is easier to read because it is normally displayed in binary or hexadecimal form (base 16) form. It does not require a translator to convert the programs because computers directly understand the machine language programs.As we all know, the programming language makes our life simpler. Currently, all sectors (like education, hospitals, banks, automobiles, and more ) completely depend upon the programming language.

					<h3>Most Used Programming Language ?</h3>

						<p> Python has overtaken Java at 2nd position and is most likely to overtake top-ranked C because C is (just like Java) losing popularity. These three languages are way ahead of others in TIOBE Index. C++ is at 4th while C# and Visual Basic .NET are very close to each other at 5th and 6th number. These five have negative trends in the past five years: Java, C, C++, C#, and PHP. PHP was at 3rd position in Mar 2010 is now at 9th. Positions of Java, C, and C++ have not been much affected, but their ratings are constantly declining. The rating of Java has declined from 26.49% in June 2001 to 10.45% in Mar 2021.TIOBE ratings are calculated by counting hits of the most popular search engines. Twenty-five search engines are used to calculate the TIOBE index. The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index started in the year 2001 and updated once a month.<br><br>
						Acc to PYPL, which publishes separate ranking for five countries, Python is the top language in all five countries (US, India, Germany, United Kingdom, France). Python has taken a huge lead in these five countries over the 2nd number of Java, and its shares are even more than double of Java in four countries except India. These two account for almost half (48%) of the global search. Python has the highest share in France, over 39%, and the lowest 31% in India.PHP is the biggest loser in recent years. Its share was over 20% in 2008; now, this fig is only 6.15% in 2021. Java is too declining but not as fast as PHP. Java's contribution was over 31% in 2008, and still, it holds 18%. In 2004-2009, 50% of the search was of either Java or PHP.

					<h4>Best Places to find knowledge for programming - </h4>
					<small>Posted on <time datetime="2021-07-13">July 13, 2021</time></small>

					<section class="post-body">
						<p>The word ‘good’ is very generic. The first thing is to be clear about your goals and then proceed with your search. Example: If you are interested in AI, then you can consider Python. For Web, you can check out Javascript.

						Some important points to keep in mind while selecting a place:

						Curriculum: Check the curriculum and see if it’s going to be useful to you (based on your goals.) Always prefer a place that provides career counseling and a personalized curriculum (you learn according to your goals).

						Mentors: Always prefer a place that has highly qualified and experienced mentors. Take time to find out about the background of the teachers before joining.<br><br>

						Practice: Learning a new language requires constant practice. The more you code & solve problems, the better your skills will get. Select a place that focuses on practice, coding exercises and problem solving. Real-world projects also help in enhancing your skills.

						Personalized Attention: Since you are learning coding, it’s best to select a place where you get personalized attention (you can clear your doubts with the teachers).

						Interview Preparation: Check if the course covers practice interview questions or not. If your ultimate aim is to clear interviews / get a job, select a course that has practice interview questions.
